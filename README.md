# Buffer
**Buffer** will be a quick, temporary cloud-based file storage and transfer system providing users with a flexible, expiration-based solution.

## Design and Workflow

The design of Buffer is aimed at simplicity, functionality, and scalability. While the layout and features are subject to change as the project develops, the current approach includes:

- **File Upload System:** A straightforward system for uploading files with support for drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Expiration Management:** A flexible expiration setup for each file, enabling users to set different expiration times as per their requirements.
- **Link Generation:** Secure, shareable links are automatically generated for easy file access.
- **File Deletion Logic:** Automatic deletion of files after the expiration period to ensure data privacy and temporary use.
- **Responsive Layout:** A responsive, mobile-friendly design to ensure smooth functionality across devices.
